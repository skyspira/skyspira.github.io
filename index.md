# Our journey ends here…

Hi guys.

In the past months we’ve encountered several issues with our server. Our server got accidentally deleted, which ultimately lead to a general lack of engagement in the staff team

## The second attempt

We quickly started to encounter financial issues, so Nic took over the responsibility for this and opened a donation page. After a while with this it came to our realization that the donations from this page weren’t sufficient to cover server costs.

After months had passed, the rebuilding works on the server had received little progress, and the financial issues were starting to become too big of a burden on us. After some discussions internally in the staff, we have come to the following conclusion:

> Due to financial issues and lack of motivation, we unfortunately have to cancel the SkySpira project here. It has been a journey for all of us, that sadly has to come to an end. Thank you for your time and we hope to see you around.
> <br/>The Staff Team

## What happens next

In the coming time, you will experience several services disappearing or stopping to function normally, including (but not limited to): the Minecraft servers, the community forums, the Dynmap, the status page, the website (will be replaced with a placeholder page), the rules portal.

Eventually, we will also archive the Discord server, and the website chat and email systems, as well as the social media profiles.

**Our services will remain open until the 1st of May, 2019, then we will be starting the closures and cancelling services.**

## The future for the community

As there still seems to be an interest in having a server, we will be considering the possibility in opening a new server. This will in that case be a server completely separated from the (former) SkySpira project, organised by people independent from the current Staff.

We will take secure backups of all our services, free of disposal to anyone interested in taking the project further. Just contact any of the Owners for more information if you’re interested.

## How can I contact Staff from now on?

We will remain available to be contacted using our email address staff@skyspira.net until the 1st of May, then we will start the shutdown of the email system along with our other systems. After this date the Staff will start to dissolve, and by the 1st of June, there will not be an official Staff Team anymore. After the 1st of June, we unfortunately do not have any official means of contact.

This was Nic,<br/>
Over and out.
